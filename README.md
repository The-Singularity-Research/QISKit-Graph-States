# QISKit-Graph-States
Graph state classes for: 

- Measurement Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) and error correction, 
- Quantum Cryptography and blind quantum computation, 
- modeling Ising type models to study quantum complexity 
- modeling quantum phase transitions (see A. Kitaev's lecture on [Topological quantum phases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2vUbTR2RWQ&t=898s)), 
- modeling condensed matter physics on IBM quantum computers. 

For two notebook tutorials on graph states, see the [error correction notebook](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/error-correction) and the [quantum cryptography notebook](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/graph-state-quantum-cryptography).
