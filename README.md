Graph state classes for: 

For two notebook tutorials on graph states, see the [error correction notebook](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/error-correction) and the [quantum cryptography notebook](https://github.com/The-Singularity-Research/graph-state-quantum-cryptography).

- Measurement Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) and error correction, 
- Quantum Cryptography and blind quantum computation (see for example [Graph States for Quantum Secret Sharing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1532.pdf) and [Verifiable measurement-only blind quantum computing with stabilizer testing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07535.pdf), 
- modeling Ising type models to study quantum complexity (see Section 5 of [Measurement-based quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.1116.pdf)
- modeling quantum phase transitions (see A. Kitaev's lecture on [Topological quantum phases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2vUbTR2RWQ&t=898s)), 
- studying entanglement entropy and entanglement as a computational resource (see [Entanglement in Graph States and its Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0602096.pdf)
- modeling condensed matter physics on IBM quantum computers.
